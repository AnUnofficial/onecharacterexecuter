# onecharacterexecuter
Executes python based on characters in a chosen file extension.

Basically, go to where it says `i.endswith(".")` and replace that with your file extension.

Then go to the `match k` and add cases of a character that runs something based on the character.

Have-a fun, or don't. Y'know, whatever. :)
